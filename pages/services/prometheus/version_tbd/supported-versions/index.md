# Supported Versions

## Package Versioning Scheme

    Prometheus: 2.2.1
    DC/OS: 1.10 and 1.11

Packages are versioned with an a.b.c-x.y.z format, where a.b.c is the version of the DC/OS integration and x.y.z indicates the version of Prometheus.
For example, 0.2.0-2.2.1 indicates version 2.2.1 of the DC/OS integration and version 2.2.1 of Prometheus.

## Version Policy

We have selected the latest stable version of Prometheus 2.2.1.
