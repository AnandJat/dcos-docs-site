# DC/OS Install

The installation of DC/OS involves configuring your infrastructure and installing DC/OS bits on top.

Some installation methods will configure your infrastructure for you, which results in limited functionality or control. These installation methods should be used for trials and proofs of concept (PoCs) only. 

For fully functional clusters on any infrastructure including on premise, public or private clouds follow the Production installation instructions.

To test or demo DC/OS on Azure, AWS, GCE, Digital Ocean, or Packet follow the cloud installation instructions. These clusters can not be upgraded and functionality may be limited. 

DC/OS can be installed on any cluster of a physical or virtual machine. 

# DC/OS Patching

A DC/OS patch describes a set of changes and supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve the features/functionality of DC/OS. A point release that consists of minor changes is also called a patch.


# DC/OS Upgrading

An upgrade is the process of moving between major releases to add new features, replace existing features with new features/functionality or performing a major configuration change. You can upgrade DC/OS only if you have used the advanced installation process to install DC/OS on your cluster.
