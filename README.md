Install packages with `npm install`

Start with command `npm start`

## SCSS

Scss files are compiled from `scss` into `build/css`

## JS

Javascript files are compiled from `js` into `build/js` and must be added to `entry.js`

## Git (TODO: Expand)

1. Before development always pull

> git pull origin master

2. Make changes, add & commit

> git add -A

> git commit -m "my change"

3. Pull before pushing

> git pull origin master

4. Push changes

> git push origin master
